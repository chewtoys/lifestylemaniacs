Ask two people or health experts what a healthy lifestyle looks like, and you will probably receive different answers. In this article, I will try to make you understand how human beings are meant to live and eliminate all possible confusions that dogmas have brought upon us.

Let's forget everything we know for a second and have an overall picture of who and what we are.

First of all, we are mammals, and for millions of years, we have been living in the wild. In the last centuries, we have been more disconnected from our true nature than ever: living indoors, moving insufficiently, eating factory food products, sleeping out of sync and poorly, living inside our heads (overthinking/overstressing).

All other living beings except humans live in nature where they were destined to live. **Nature separation is where we have gone wrong.**

If we are meant to live in nature, we have to accept whatever and whenever nature has to offer.

But do we need?

# Food
We need natural food. Food that is found almost ready to eat in nature and unaltered by man. We also need to keep in mind seasons and climate.

We are not herbivores, like elephants or giraffes, because we don't have big multi-chamber stomachs. We are also not carnivores (predators), because we don't have huge claws and teeth like tigers. We are something in between - **hunter-gatherers.**

We need to eat fresh vegetables and fruits (and some nuts and seeds from the shell) in seasons. The rest of the time, we need to hunt wild animals.

We also don't eat to eat all the time, because food may not be available all the time. Thus, **intermittent-fasting** may be in order as it is a natural thing to do, especially for consuming our stored energy (body fat).

Practicality: **eat freshly gathered vegetables and fruits with some nuts and seeds** (preferably, in your season and climate) **and wild-like (living like in the wild) animals.** Try **intermittent-fasting.**

# Water
Naturally (in the wild), we would drink only fresh spring water; hence, we should try to find the most unaltered water out there. Compared to regular tap water, spring water contains lots of minerals, and it is slightly alkaline.

Of course, springs are not at every step, but we can there is **spring bottled water** in the markets. Just keep your eyes open for scams. Many bottles of water contain tap water.

If you want to be more guaranteed, you can buy a water filter. The best one is the **reverse osmosis filter**. Other filters may also be fine if you are not living in polluted cities like New York.

Practicality: **drink fresh spring water or purified water.**

# Movement
Hunter-gatherers hunt and gather, which means spending most of the day on foot walking and carrying heavy things. Also, we need to ensure shelter which mens some hard labor. In some critical cases, we may also need to run to save our lives from predators.

We are meant to do **low-impact physical activity most of the day, mainly walking, and high-impact physical activity from time to time**.

Practicality: **keep moving throughout the day**, mainly walking, **and engage in some regular high-intensity exercise**, like sprints and strength training.

# Sleep
As wild animals, our circadian rhythms have been guided by the sun, and still is. Unfortunately, electricity (artificial light) has been messing up with our biological clock, and we no longer get the good quality sleep we once had.

You see, **sleep quantity is not that important**. Really! Have you ever heard people telling you they slept 6 hours, but still feel refreshed? Or, on the other side, have you ever heard people sleeping for 12 hours and always be tired?

The reason is the sleep quality.  The better the quality, the better the effect of sleep has on our body, like healing and assimilation.

How to achieve good quality sleep? We need to try to simulate the environment we once had back when we lived in the wild.

Practicality: **go to bed and wake up at the same hours** (ideally, by the sun)**, avoid light before sleep** (>1 hour)**, and keep the bedroom dark and cool.**

# Sunlight and Fresh Air
The only time we would spend inside would be during the night and bad weather. The rest of the time, wild humans would spend outside in the sunlight and fresh air. Nowadays, we spend most of our lives in boxes (houses, cars, buses, trains) which makes us deprived of fresh air and sunlight.

**We need sunlight for vitamin D, which is a precursor for a lot of hormones.** We also need fresh air for oxygen, of course.

Now, we live on a polluted planet, which is a big pitty, and we can hardly find fresh air. We don't need to be perfect, though, so **spending time in nature is enough.** 

Practicality: **spend some time in nature or outside at least 1 hour every day.**

# Relationships
If we look in nature, we see animal groups everywhere. Rarely animals live alone, including humans. **Humans are social beings**. We have evolved living in tribes and communities. We looked after one another, and this is what we should.

Unfortunately, technological evolution and its overuse have disconnected us from each other. Rarely we connect and spend good time with the people who matter. Social media is a major reason why depression and anxiety are on the rise.

There is a catch to this. You are better of living alone than with toxic people. I, for instance, spend most time alone, because I cannot find some people with whom I can resonate. I am happy, though. I feel free and limitless all the time.

Practicality: **spend time with good quality people and avoid toxic people.**

# Play
"Stop being a child! Grow up! Be serious!" - They say.

We live in a serious world where being juvenile is a sin, especially making mistakes. This serious and super-fast world has made us forget to play and spend some regular leisure time.

We must be productive, right? Well, it seems that taking time to play and unwind can increase overall productivity.

Play can have any form, from playing a sport to spending time with the children or making a fool out of oneself. The idea is to **have fun and let the inner child come out**.

Practicality: **have fun and enjoy life as often as possible**.

# Summary
