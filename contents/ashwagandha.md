Ashwagandha, Withania Somnifera, or Indian Ginseng is a medicinal root that has been used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine for **immunity, stress-relief, and stamina**.

Ashwagandha is an **adaptogenic herb** that helps us cope with stress. The name "somnifera" by itself indicates the **sleep-inducing and relaxation** power of the herb.

Ashwagandha is an excellent **antiviral and antitumor** herb, because of its **withanolide D** (phytosterol) content. It also contains flavonoids, antioxidants (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione), alkaloids, amino acids (tryptophan), neurotransmitters, tannins, lignans, and triterpenes.

All these compound give ashwagandha its unique beneficial properties.
