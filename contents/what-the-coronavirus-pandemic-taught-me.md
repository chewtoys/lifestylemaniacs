There is no questioning that this year (2020) is a challenging year for humanity. We are with no doubt at war from all points of view.

-   the economy is about to crash;
-   people die and are sick all around the planet;
-   we need to stay at home without seeing our close ones;
-   some of us are unemployed;
-   some of us work critical hours to help humanity (e.g., medical doctors, nurses, firefighters, military, police).

The Coronavirus threatens not only our health but also our finances and psyche. **We face a new depression, probably the new great depression of the 21st century.**

These are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. These challenges are useless if we don't learn anything from them. We as humanity need to make a change. Let's take a look at some lessons I learned from this, and maybe so did you.

# 1. Health is the most critical asset

I learned this lesson 7 years ago, but repetition is the mother of skills. We need to take care of our health in a proactive fashion. Not cure, but prevent. We need to invest in our health like in our child.

It is selfish to not take care of you before others. You know why? Because if you don't take care of yourself, you won't have the energy and strength, both physical and mental, to take care of others. That is how you need to think.

Take care of yourself so that you live to take care of others. **You are useless on this planet if you're dead or sick.**

We are also in a position where no amount of money can buy health, simply because we have no cure. **Our only treatment and shield against this virus (and any pathogen) is our immune system**. And it pisses me off that we are not informed about how to strengthen our immunity. 

All I see and hear is stay at home, keep the distance, sanitize, wear masks, and gloves. I agree with hand washing and keeping them away from your face. However, **staying at home is counterintuitive**.

Our immune system needs vitamin D. Stay closed at home, no sunlight, no vitamin D, no serotonin (happiness), no immunity. Gather around the other factors of unhappiness and stress (no money, no job, loneliness), and our immune system is compromised.

You see, the advice that should protect us does more harm than good.

If I were a leader or influencer, I would have suggested:

-   avoid closed and public areas;
-   wear masks and gloves when physically contacting new people;
-   wash your hands, wallet, phone, and keys, when coming home;
-   wash your hands before touching your face or eating;
-   save your money (don't buy what you don't need);
-   limit alcohol and smoking;
-   eat real food and limit processed food;
-   drink plenty of water;
-   get 6-10 hours of regular sleep (depending on age);
-   exercise daily, especially outdoors in nature;
-   take some immunity supplements (e.g., vitamin d3, zinc, ashwagandha, ginger, turmeric, medicinal mushrooms).

These, my friend, are real pieces of advice we all need to incorporate for life, even after we'll have eradicated the virus.

# 2. Money is useless if you can't use it

There was a rumor that there will no longer be food in the market or that all food markets will be closed. Also, all restaurants, bars, clothing shops, everything except online and food markets are closed. Not only that, what is the point of buying expensive clothing when you no one sees you? Frankly, no one even gives a shit about looks in these dark times.

**What is the point of having more money than you need in these times if all you can buy - and should buy - are strict daily requirements?**

My advice to everybody, including myself, is to save your money, and, if you have too much, donate to people in need. Trust me; some people really need the money more than you do.

# 3. Be prepared for anything

I am lucky in this sense. My life made me crave independence, and I continue to live independently as much as possible.

-   I invested in a minimal home gym;
-   I take cold showers;
-   I spend most time alone;
-   I work remotely;
-   I cook and prepare my food;
-   I live a healthy lifestyle;
-   I don't depend on my parents.

I am lucky, and I have created my luck for seven years now, and it seems all the sacrifices paid out.

Life is unpredictable and makes sure our plans don't apply. **We, as humans, need to be able to adapt to whatever life brings us.** It is the species with the most significant power to change that will survive and hopefully thrive.

# 4. Loneliness is a slow killer

Loneliness is a more significant cause of heart disease than alcohol and smoking. We can learn to live alone, but we will never thrive on this lifestyle, only survive. We are social beings, and we need to love and be loved.

We need to share, laugh, talk, and feel the energy of people around us.

You may say we have social media and messaging apps to chit-chat, but this is not and never be a solution. I feel more depressed after spending time on social media than not spending time on it at all. A virtual connection is not nearly as powerful as a physical connection.

**Let us focus more on seeing people in real life and living outside of this virtual reality**. We need to learn to be human again and step away from the hypocrisy social media has to bring. **What we see on social media is a perfect, fairy-tale, unicorn life, and we know it.**

Life will never be perfect. Life is, most of the time, a routine, monotonous, and we need to accept that. We become successful through consistency, which is a routine. I agree that we need a break from time to time, but not all the time.

**We need to take breaks when our life and goals are at peace**, that is how I become who I am, through sacrifice and monotony, and I am proud of who I am, respected or not.

Now, I also sometimes put pictures on social media and maybe regret afterwards, but this is because my subconscious thinks I should do so. After all, everyone does so. 

The truth is, **we often share to receive attention through comments and likes. We get temporary satisfaction, but it is not the real deal.** The likes and comments are for what we shared, not for who shared.

**Social media friends and followers are not and never will be real friends.**

# 5. Not everything we read or hear is true

Everybody is an expert and has an opinion these days. It is funny that those with the lowest expertise are the ones with the most significant criticism and shout out. There are also influencers and, just because they are well known, they're opinion matters.

**We need to learn to ask questions and think before believing and applying others' pieces of advice.**

Just ask, "why?". Does it make any sense? Learn to do your research and get familiar with all scientific areas to avoid being fooled.

**The cause of the corona-panic was the misinformation spread and believed on social media**. Also, the numbers of deaths and infected cases are both overrated and underrated from one country to another.

Reporters make everything so dramatic and resentence phrases just to be catchy. Their priority is to spread the news and to make people read it, regardless of the story.

**Think outside the box, stay curious, and ask questions.**
