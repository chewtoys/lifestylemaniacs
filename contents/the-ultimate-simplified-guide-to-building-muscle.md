It's time to eliminate the fitness industry bullshit and get old-school. Muscle building is all about science.

## Muscle Anatomy and Physiology
![Muscle anatomy](/assets/images/the-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle/muscle-fibers.png 'Muscle fibers')

**Muscle fibers** compose the muscle and **myofibrils** compose a muscle fiber. The nervous system innervates muscle fibers via **motor neurons**.
Only one motor neuron can innervate one or more muscle fibers of the same type. A motor neuron and its fibers are called a **motor unit.**

There are three types of muscle fibers:
- **Type I: slow-twitch/oxidative;**
- **Type IIA: fast-twitch/oxidative;**
- **Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.**

<br>
Type II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.
Type I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.

The size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).

The primary energy currency for all cells is **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**.

The **mitochondria** are responsible for producing ATP via:
- **Phosphagen system** (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);
- **Anaerobic glycolysis** (anaerobic);
- **Oxidative phosphorylation** (aerobic) - Kreb's cycle and electron transport chain.

<br>

ATP replenishment times:
- 20 sec - 50.00 %;
- 40 sec - 75.00 %;
- 1 min - 87.50 %;
- 80 sec - 93.75 %;
- 100 sec - 96.88 %;
- 2 mins - 98.44 %;
- 140 sec - 99.22 %;
- 160 sec - 99.61 %;
- 3 min - 99.81 %.

## Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)
There are two types of hypertrophy:
- **Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy**;
- **Sarcomere hypertrophy**.

<br>
Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive. Thus, more mitochondria, more enzymes, more ATP, and more endurance (mostly type I fibers).

Sarcomere hypertrophy is an increase in the volume of contractile machinery - the highest potential for increasing muscle cell size and strength (mostly type II fibers).

**_Muscle fiber development occurs as a result of cellular damage or trauma (stress) caused by sufficient tension for sufficient time given the adequate nutrients and the adequate recovery time._**

When this happens, stem cells around the muscle cells called **satellite cells** become similar to muscle cells and donate their nuclei to the muscle fibers.

Hormones and growth factors are also produced as a result of cell damage:
- **Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1);**
- **Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF);**
- **Transforming Growth Factor -Beta Superfamily (TGF-beta);**
- **Growth hormone (GH);**
- **Testosterone.**

<br>
The muscle fiber repair and growth lasts for several hours to several days, depending on the stress level.

## Efficient, targeted strength training
If our goals are to build muscle or/and strength, we need to lift heavy enough (tension ) and for adequate time. But what is sufficient and enough? Let's see:

|Fiber type|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|
|--|--|--|--|
|Type I|+15|70%|2 - 0 - 1|
|Type IIA|6-12|75-85%|4 - 0 - 3|
|Type IIB|1-3|+90%|3 - 1 - 1|

<br>
Geekier:
<br>

|Training goal|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|
|--|--|--|--|
|Type I sarcomere hypertrophy|15-50|<70%|2-0-1|
|Type I sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|>50|<50%|2-0-1|
|Type IIA sarcomere hypertrophy|6-15|70-85%|4-0-3|
|Type IIA sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|12-25|50-70%|4-0-3|
|Type IIB sarcomere hypertrophy|3-5|85-95%|3-1-1|
|Type IIB sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|6-12|70-85%|3-1-1|
|Absolute strength|1-2|>90%|3-1-1|

<br>
Briefly:
<br>

|Training goal|Sets|Reps per set|%1rep-max(1RM)|
|--|--|--|--|
|Maximum muscle size|3|6-12|75-85%|
|Maximum strength|3-7|1-5|>85%|
|Combined muscle and strength|3|3-12|75-90%|

<br>

Be careful to **perform each repetition with proper form, no cheating, or ego lifting.** Start with weights that you feel most confident you can perform 12-15 reps for the first set and increase from there.

## Best strength training exercises
The best strength training exercises are unquestionably the **free weight compound movements:**
- **Squats;**
- **Deadlifts;**
- **Bench Presses / Weighted Push-ups;**
- **Parallel Dips;**
- **Bent Over Rows**
- **Pull-ups / Chin-Ups**
- **Military Presses**

<br>
These should be the cornerstone of our training routine. You should add isolation exercises only you lack strength or size in specific muscle group areas.

Try to avoid training to failure when training for strength to prevent nervous system burnout.

Constantly progress or change the workout routines, because the body adapts. Constantly change the exercises and increase intensity/weights when you feel you reached a plateau.
  
## Training frequency
The muscle fibers need time to recover for efficient development. The recovery process and anabolic period last for 48-72 hours. For this reason, we must **train each muscle group 2-3 times per week**. How we accomplish this depends on the schedule of each individual and genetics.

For busy people who don't have much time to spend in the gym, **three weekly full-body training sessions based on compound exercises is enough**. This program also applies to small-boned/small-jointed people.

Small-boned characteristics:
- Wrist circumferences <10.5% of the height;
- Ankle circumferences <13.0% of the height.

<br>
If you are not a fan of full-body training, you can experiment with different splits out there and see which one suits you.

Keep in mind that regardless of the muscle group your training, all the body's systems are affected: glycogen, enzymes, ATP, CP, etc. Thus, the muscles may recover, but the other systems may still be fatigued.

Ideally, **a rest day should follow each training day.**

Muscle fatigue is caused by:
- Lactic acid accumulation;
- ATP shortage;
- PC shortage;
- Inorganic phosphate accumulation;
- Peripheral nervous system fatigue;
- Central nervous system fatigue.

<br>

The **training session should be for 45-75 minutes**.

## Diet
For building muscle, we need **minimum 2g/kg of body weight of (complete) protein per day, minimum 1g/kg of body weight of dietary fat per day,** and **10% caloric surplus**. Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.

The primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) **whole foods** and not fitness supplements.
Probably, the only supplements I recommend are:
- Good quality **Complete protein powder** (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);
- **Creatine monohydrate** or complex;
- **Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex** (extracted from natural food sources);
- **Krill Oil** (Omega-3s).

<br>
Other supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.

## Other lifestyle factors
Of course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. **Sleep** is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.

Sleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between **10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.**, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to **go to sleep and wake up at the same hours** every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.

Make sure to **stay hydrated**. We need **2-6L of water per day**, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.

**Chronic stress** is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant. Massage is also a good idea.

## Summary
This is what you should get from this article:
- train each muscle group 2-3 times per week;
- focus on compound exercises and limit isolation exercises;
- execute each repetition with good form and avoid ego lifting;
- for muscle volume, 3 sets of 6-12 reps in 75-85% RM with 2-0-1 cadence;
- for strength, 3-7 sets of 1-5 reps in >85% RM with 3-1-1 cadence;
- for combined muscle and strength, 3 sets of 3-12 reps in 75-90% RM with 4-1-3 cadence;
- constantly increase the intensity and variate each exercise to avoid plateau;
- rest ~2 minutes between sets;
- train for 45-75 minutes;
- ideally, rest day after every training day for full system recovery;
- whole good quality food;
- min 1g/kg/day of complete protein;
- min 1g/kg/day of dietary fat;
- scheduled good quality sleep;
- 2-6L water per day;
- relaxation (deep breathing, massage, meditation, etc.).
