When we were children, we were taught that during winter and cold periods we catch colds, flu, infections, and so on, because of decreased temperature. This knowledge remains and we continue to spread it within our relationships. Is this actually true?

<!-- more -->

This idea is far from the truth. If we take a step back in our lives and watch our lifestyle changes during cold periods, we will immediately notice something interesting and different from our lifestyle during warm periods.

- during cold periods we avoid spending time outside;
- during cold periods we eat less fresh food and, nowadays, less from our own country.

These are the major differences between cold periods and winter periods. Now, we can conclude the true reasons why we get sick in winter

## 1. Less sunlight

During winter the sky is most often cloudy and less direct sunlight exposure occurs. Also, as I mentioned, we spend more time in our house, in cars, buses, trains, local languages. This leads to vitamin D(3) deficiency which causes a chain reaction of other deficiencies and imbalances;
- imbalanced calcium/phosphorus ratio;
- weak immune system;
- [depression and anxiety](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0348-5).

Read more about Vitamin D metabolism and its role [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2879391/).

## 2. Less oxygen

Spending more time indoors, especially non-oxygenated rooms creates a perfect environment for (anaerobic) bacteria and viruses to thrive. Not to mention that **oxygen is the essential nutrient of life**. All metabolic processes within our cells, hence our body, run on oxygen. Without oxygen, you're dead.

Nobel prize winner Dr. Otto Heinrich Warburg revealed how cancer cells thrive in anaerobic (acidic) environments. Furthermore, he pointed out that the true cause of oxygen and tumors is oxygen deficiency, thus, low pH (acidic) body - the [Warburg hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_hypothesis).

{% blockquote Otto Heinrich Warburg %}
All normal cells have an absolute requirement for oxygen, but cancer cells can live without oxygen - a rule without exception. Deprive a cell 35% of its oxygen for 48 hours and it may become cancerous.

{% endblockquote %}

## 3. Non-fresh food

During cold periods we eat more frozen, canned, jarred, dried, cooked, and non-local foods. This reduces a big amount of vitamins, minerals, and enzymes our unique body needs, which are found in fresh fruits and vegetables.

## 4. Less active

This is actually a consequence of the three above. LAck of vitamin D, oxygen, and local fresh foods, makes us lazier, unmotivated, more depressed, etc.

## What can you do?

You already know the answer, you just need to accept it. **Get out and open the windows!**. Also, eat more fatty wild caught fish, like, mackerel, salmon, sardines or take some [cod liver oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3P4PO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003B3P4PO&linkCode=as2&tag=razvantomegea-20&linkId=eb5f3b89800d310d8f954d1cb9576a2d).

I spend walk 10 miles outside every single day, no matter what.
I open the windows home ever since I wake up until evening, 2 hours before I go to bed. I also keep the windows open near me at the office (until my colleagues shut it because they don't understand the consequences of unoxygenated rooms).
I take a tablespoon of cod liver oil every morning.
I eat fermented foods and fresh local grown apples periodically.

As a result, I haven't been sick, sneezing, coughing, etc. for more than 2 years, I have energy all day, and it's impossible for me not to smile and stay optimistic.
