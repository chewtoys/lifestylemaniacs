I understand you completely. You love pizza, french fries, cookies, pastries, croissants, cakes, candies, potato chips, biscuits, Oreos, Twinkies, Snickers, Bounties, Mars, Twix, Popcorn, burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, fish sticks, crackers, chocolate, truffles, ice cream, mousse, and so on and so forth. I loved them too. They taste and smell so damn good, they make you feel so good... they are addicting! They are actually more addicting than drugs and while they are making you feel good in the foreground, they are killing you in the background. Fortunately, for every problem, there is always a solution. The question is: have you the power to accept the solution? <!-- more -->

Here's the thing! All the processed foods listed above have something in common: they contain (along with other synthetic preservatives, sweeteners, and taste enhancers) vegetable oils, sugars, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). All of these make them addicting so that they make your brain release opioids and dopamine. As a result, they make you feel good, satisfied temporarily, but make you unhappy afterward - as drugs - so you are needed to keep eating them to extend that feeling of pleasure.

You become a victim. You are aware they are not good for you, but you still buy them and eat them. You can't stop! You feel like if you don't eat them or finish the whole bag, life is worthless. You keep saying to yourself: "I deserve this?", "Why should I stop?", "I work hard all day and I deserve a reward. What's the point of life if I can't enjoy myself?". This attitude and thinking are the ones of an addict. When I was smoking and I tried to quit for the first time, I had the same thinking. Alcoholics have the same thinking. You also notice withdrawals symptoms when you are not indulging.

Please, stick with me, okay? Nobody says you have to give up indulging from time to time. Nobody says you can reward yourself. What I am trying to tell you is, **these substances will never make you feel like you had enough**. So, one cookie, one Twinkie, several potato chips are never enough.

Now here's the good part: what if I told you, there is homemade, healthy substitute for every junk food on the market? Yes, there is! You just need to open your favorite search engine and search; or if you are an experienced cook, you just need to use your imagination and play in the kitchen. The best place to find inspiration is Pinterest. Just make an experiment: go on https://pinterest.com and search for "homemade snickers". You will be amazed! I was amazed!

You can substitute every junk food with a healthy version. I promise you, you will always stop before you finish the whole portion. Why? Becuase **when it comes to healthy food cooked well, it doesn't offer only intense flavors and good taste, but also nutrition.** Just be careful to **use natural fats (coconut oil, butter, avocado, nuts, seeds) instead of vegetable oils, natural sugars - as minimal as possible - (stevia, fresh or dried fruits, honey, brown sugar) instead of artificial sweeteners, and natural whole ingredients instead of synthetic processed ingredients.**

- french fries? buy some potatoes, peel them, wash them, slice them, heat some butter or coconut oil and fry them;
- popcorn? buy some corn, heat some butter or coconut oil and pop it;
- snickers? cacao, peanut butter, vanilla, milk, honey or melted sugar;
- cookies? milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, stevia/brown sugar/banana/dried fruit, almond flour/coconut flour/chickpeas/oats/sweet potatoes;
- pudding? avocado, banana, vanilla, cinnamon, cacao;
- more? head over on [Pinterest](https://ro.pinterest.com/), [Yummly](https://www.yummly.com/), [Allrecipes](http://allrecipes.com/), [Dr. Berg's recipes](https://www.drberg.com/recipes), [Mark Sisson's recipes](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/recipes-home/), [Dr. Mercola's recipes](http://recipes.mercola.com/), [Mark Hyman's recipes](http://drhyman.com/blog/category/recipes/), [Dr. Axe's recipes](https://draxe.com/section/recipes/).

I get it, when you are away from home and pass through a fast-food or bakery and feel that "delicious" smell you feel like you can't stop yourself from buying it. I understand you! I also love the smell, but I am conscious! I care about my body! I love my body! You don't! That's the truth! You'd rather be sick, die, or sacrifice a lifetime of happiness for 30 minutes of pleasure! That's the truth! You need to control yourself! Be aware of the costs! And I told you: you can reward yourself with cookies, cakes, biscuits, you name it. Just make yourself!

Next time you feel the delightful scent on the street, have a little patience for crying out loud. Wait until you go home and make it yourself! Or better yet, prepare it in advance and carry it with you for the times you have cravings.
