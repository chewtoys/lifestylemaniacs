I decided to write a small guide on nutrition for everyone to comprehend. There are many guides out there on the web, so why even bother you may think? Let's say, repetition is key to memorization. It's never a bad thing to review what you already know.

I believe nutrition is one of the essential pieces of the health and fitness puzzle.

What is nutrition? Nutrition is a science. **Nutrition is the science of how food components (nutrients) transform and interact within our bodies**. Thus, our focus is on what those food components nutrients are and what they do.

# Nutrients

Our body requires the nutrient compounds present in food. The more nutrient-dense food is, the higher it's quality.

## Macronutrients

-   Carbohydrates;
-   Proteins;
-   Lipids;
-   Water.

## Micronutrients

-   Vitamins;
-   Minerals.

We should no longer see food as just belly-filling, hunger inhibiting substance. Food should be cellular nourishment.

## Essential nutrients

Now, upon these nutrients, not all of them are essential. Some of them can be produced internally by the body (non-essential). Our focus should be mostly on the essential nutrients.

-   **Water**;
-   **Major Minerals** (Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium);
-   **Trace Minerals** (Iron, Iodine, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Cobalt, Chromium, Selenium, Molybdenum, Fluorine);
-   **Amino Acids** (Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine);
-   **Fatty Acids** (Linoleic acid, Linolenic acid, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid);
-   **Vitamins** (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic acid, Pyridoxine, Biotin, Folic acid, Cobalamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Choline).

In the next articles, we'll focus on each nutrient group. Stay tuned!
