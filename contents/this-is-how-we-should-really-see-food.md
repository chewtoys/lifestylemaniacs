I genuinely believe we humans are out of touch with the food on our plates or hands as few still eat at home or a good restaurant.
It's hard for me and for those who hang out with their friends from time to time to explain why we don't eat at any local out there. Even our families rarely understand.

*"Come on! It's good! It's just (you name it)"* - they say.
They also say: *"Why don't you eat this or that recipe? It's good!"*

Their definition of good food or meal is opposite to my (our) definition of good. **When people say "it's good," they mean it tastes good**. And this is where it all starts to go wrong.

# Eatable, not too delicious or distasteful

People only eat the food that tastes good, regardless of its source, quality, preparation methods, and so on. It is why it's so hard to eat food made at home.

**Homemade (real) food doesn't have that intense taste as processed food does because it lacks MSG (Monosodium Glutamate)**. MSG is a taste enhancer which is present in all fast-foods and packaged ready-to-eat meals.

However, real food has also lost its taste through time because the soils are depleted of minerals and real food lacks the nutrients it once had. You know what I mean; that tomato without taste that used to have 20 years ago.

In reality, it's not our fault. **We eat food that tastes (and smells) good because of a defense mechanism we developed through millions of years.** Back then, food that smelled and tasted terrible was not digestible or even poisoning.

Today, we have science and other methods to determine which food is good or bad without using our senses. Also, some foods taste bad but are good for us. For instance, medicinal mushrooms taste horrible but are incredibly healthy in small doses.

Now, I am not saying we should eat food that tastes bad but eat food that is a little beat higher than neutral at the taste. Not too good and not bad; just right.

**Food that tastes too good is also addictive**, and most of the time, we eat it for pleasure, not because we are hungry, which leads us to the next key point.

# Only when truly hungry

Our body knows when we are starving, and that is the only time when we should eat. That's how every species on the planet has been doing it from the beginning of time. Hunt, catch the pray (if possible), eat, and then wait until the next hunt (1-3 days).

The exception is, of course, herbivores and animals living in the tropics which have food all seasons, but even they have to fight for their food with their lives as they are the primary hunting target for predators.

We now eat when we work, when we watch a movie or show, when we go out, when we are bored, when the clock ticks the time, when we are sad, when we are happy, when we are depressed, when we are angry, when we are thirsty, when we pass by a local food joint, etc.

We rarely eat when we need to and what we need to.

# What nourishes our body

I think 75% of the population is not aware of this crucial point. Food is not belly-filling or hunger-inhibitor. **Food is nourishment and information.**

**Food tells the body (DNA) what to become and what to pass to the next generation**. Yes, if you want healthy and beautiful children, be careful of what you eat at least five years before.

If we eat crappy or good for nothing food, we become crappy and good for nothing, and we pass crappy and good for nothing genes to our children.

**Good quality food is the food with the most essential nutrients** (amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and other phytochemicals) **per kilocalorie** (fresh or freshly frozen vegetables, fruit, and wild or pasture-raised animal meat.)

All processed foods are high in calories and low in essential nutrients. That is why people are diabetic, obese, sick, and tired.

See food as nourishment and energy, not as sensorial-pleasing, belly-filling, digestible products.

# Summary

- **choose (generally) homemade meals** (shop regularly);
- **meals should be eatable (natural taste)**, not too tasty or disgusting;
- **eat only when truly hungry**, not when food is in sight, by emotion, or by schedule;
- **choose food with the most essential nutrients per kilocalorie**.
