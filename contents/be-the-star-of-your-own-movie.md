    All things splendid have been achieved by those who dared believe that something inside them was superior to circumstance.

When we are children, we see ourselves as superheros from comic books and cartoons. I enjoyed imagining myself as Batman and Spider-Man. I also wished I could fly or have superpowers like those from X-Men. I don't know if kids nowadays still play like this, but I know this is what made me dream. Me, seeing myself as something greater, bigger, stronger, is what gave me energy.

I remembered I used to look up in the sky an imagine myself being anything. This started to fall apart though as I grew up and as teachers and adults have been started to tell me that I can't be whatever I want. I have to go to school, go to college, get a degree, get a job, start a family, and, eventually, die.

So many children, including me, haven't been encouraged by their loved ones to pursue their dream, what their heart desired - what gave them the chills when thinking about it. This is because parents are afraid; they are scared off their a** that their children won't earn money to sustain themselves. They don't trust their own children, so they advice them to be average and follow the lead. Be like everybody, because it's safer. The thing is, nothing in life is promised except death. Everything, except death, is insecure.

Say you have been working in a company for a couple of years. Say you have a contract. What guarantee do you have that tomorrow you won't be fired or that the company won't disappear after a couple of years.

    I learned many, many lessons from my father, but not least of which is that you can fail at something you donâ€™t want, so you might as well take a chance doing what you love.
{% endblockquote %}

This common - average - path the majority of people has been following for decades is what has made the world a sad and ugly place. People are unfulfilled, disappointed, frustrated, unhappy only because they have never listened to their heart and because they listened to what others told them.

I refuse to be average. I refuse to become a frustrated middle-aged man. I want to be happy and I want to die fulfilled. I don't want to waste my life being somebody else - like everyone else.

We are all special. We are all unique. We don't need capes, colored tights, laser beam, or supernatural abilities to be superheroes. The only thing we need to to is be ourselves and follow the voice within. Not the voice in our head, but the voice in our heart, because that's the place where God lies.

We are living too much in our head. Our thoughts are constantly manipulated by industries, relationships, etc. Unless you are living alone far from the city, you cannot know for sure that your thoughts are yours. The only think you know for sure is tha voice of your heart. The heart cannot be be manipulated, it only can be silenced by our lousy thoughts. This has made us disconnected with ourselves. We need to reconnect with ourselves, listen to our heart - God - and live; I mean truly live, not just exist - walking dead.

We are the main characters of a marvelous movie called ***Life***. Life has to be lived. Living involves being and feeling not just doing and thinking. When we think too much we disconnect from the present. We think too much and feel too less.

My message is to stop. Just stop for a minute and look around. Stop thinking about the past and the future. Just stop and be! I won't expect you to succeed. It is a discipline not to do anything and just be; just enjoy the moment! Enjoy being alive! It's hard for me too! In our century of speed, everywhere is just: *"Do, do, do! Think, think, think!"*.

I used to be a workaholic, but I realized it consumed me and it led to my self-destruction. If I wasted 30 minutes to relax, I thought I have lost time. It's a virus! Now, I have integrated mindful meditation in my schedule and it has helped me to reconnect with my true self. It has helped me to reborn and dream again. It has brought me back to my movie. I am again able to dream as a child.

My advice is to awake the lost child within and dream again. Come back! Reconnect to your inner self and see the infinite possibilities you are able to be. Remember what gives you the chills just thinking about it!

Whenever I listen to music and begin to dance, whenever I can hear and feel the beat resonating with my heart I feel like resurrecting, flying, transforming. I feel more alive than ever!

What make you feel alive? That is your superpower! Do whatever makes you feel alive! Close your eyes, feel alive, and be! Enjoy the movie you are producing and acting in.

At the beginning, you will be afraid, I was too. I used to think about what others would think and say. I no longer care about what others say and think about me, because I am proud of myself. The funny thing is, people see you as you see you. If you see yourself as your best self, if your work on yourself everyday and improve everyday, if you gain confidence and selfasteem, everybody will respect you and will smile to you. The world changes. ***The way you see yourself is the way the world sees you, and it is the way you see the world.***.

Follow your heart, be your own superhero, and live!
