Morning is the most important part of the day. It sets our momentum for the rest of the day, so how we manage is crucial. We can set ourselves off either for success, either for failure.

## Checking the news (do not)
The worst thing to do first thing in the morning is checking our phone or pc as it will sabotage our entire day. But why?
Chelsea Pottenger, a wellbeing expert, and consultant at EQ Consulting, in a [study](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.whimn.com.au/strength/health/the-major-risks-of-checking-your-phone-first-thing-in-the-mornings/news-story/93e51aed44e5d475309c44f894a20d5f), concluded that:

>"When we first wake up, we transition from a delta brainwave of sleep into a theta brain wave - where the brain is more flexible and malleable. The theta brainwave is vital to becoming more emotionally intelligent individuals, creative and adept at problem-solving."

The act of checking our emails, the news or the social media feed, we are substituting the important theta brain wave with the beta brainwave of high stress.
This has a significant impact on the physical structure of the brain, on our ability to perform, and our general wellness.

## Set goals (do)
Instead of acting as a receiver and receiving information from the outside world we should act as senders and send our intentions to the Universe and set our goals for the day as clearly as possible.
This is uncomfortable at the beginning, almost impossible even, but there is a morning routine that will give you the boost for success


## Make your bed (definitely, do)
The simple act of making your bed will give you the mindset of accomplishment and discipline. You achieved your first goal for the day and now you're warmed up for the rest of them.
Believe it or not, few people make their bed first thing in the morning and all of those who do, are successful. It is a pattern.


## Summary
in the morning, our brain is most malleable and flexible (vulnerable to wrong information);
avoid the news, social media, emails, and any information first 30 minutes in the morning;
make your bed and set goals first thing in the morning to have a successful day.
