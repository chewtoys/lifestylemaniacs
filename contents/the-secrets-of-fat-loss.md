Oh, I know what you're thinking right now: "Not another fat loss post to confuse me even further...". Stay with me as our posts are always short and concise.

There are many magic pills spread around the web that guarantee easy and rapid fat loss. I am sorry for disappointing you, but if you are looking for the easy and fast solution, you are going to crash and burn.

**Fat loss is all about human physiology.** If you understand the basics (like everything in life) you will no longer waste your time, money, and energy on useless crap.

Don't get me wrong, the human body is an amazingly complex machine that is influenced by the environment, so it's impossible to track everything; we can't be perfect.

But let's focus on what we can control, okay?

2 major factors impact fat loss:

## Energy deficit

Of course, I am talking about calories. This is the golden rule, you cannot eat anything as much as you can without getting fat, regardless of how healthy it is.

## Hormones

Hormones are, basically, chemical messengers that help our cells communicate with each other. Hormones dictate our state, how we feel, okay? This includes hunger.

The golden rule for permanent and smart fat loss is a combination of the two factors above:

**Maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.**

Make sure you remember this: maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.

This is where all diets fail. They either do not maintain a proper energy deficit, either are making you hungrier day by day, either they don't help you tap into the fat stores for energy, but your muscles.

The most effective fat loss diet, in my opinion, is the Paleo diet. Why? It is most easier to maintain, it's balanced, and it helps you achieve energy deficit without even thinking about it. You feel full all the time.

The secret? **Include whole foods found in nature**. Whole foods are high in protein, fiber, water, (healthy) fats, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, etc and are minimally processed.

These foods nourish your body to the cellular level with minimum energy. As a result, you will feel full, satisfied, energized, and in an energy deficit.

I will recommend you use at the beginning a food tracker like **MyFitnessPal** to have an estimate of your daily nutrient and energy intake.

For fat loss, you should set **a 10% energy deficit.**

Let's not forget about 2 important combos to fat loss: **movement and sleep**.

I am not talking about exercise like running, boxing, or strength training, but movement. Move your body as much as possible. Exercise is not for fat loss, remember that.

Movement is - besides other health benefits - for fat loss. Why? You burn more energy through day to day movement than exercise. Take the stairs, go to work or school by foot or bicycle, stand on your desk, etc.

**Avoid sitting as much as possible and be active throughout the day.**

Sleep is our primary hormone regulator - melatonin. Without good quality sleep (from **10:00 p.m. to 5:00 - 7:00 a.m.**), our body won't be able to heal itself and burn energy from fat.

Also, **sleep deprivation makes you hungrier** and makes you crave sugary or/and fatty foods.

It's hard to have a healthy sleep schedule nowadays, I know, but you have to make some decisions for yourself if you want to have results.

I told you from the beginning if you are looking for the magic pill, you came in the wrong place.

Now we know how to maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry. But what about tapping into fat stores?

To tap into our fat store we need to manage one hormone: **insulin**.

Insulin is the anabolic hormone that opens the gates to our cells to receive energy and nutrients. This includes fat cells.

Remember this rule: **it's impossible to burn fat when insulin is in the blood.**

The question is now: when is insulin in the blood?

Insulin is secreted mostly after consuming carbohydrates, especially those without fiber (processed) and protein; **fats don't give any insulin response**.

There has also been debunked that **insulin is secreted even when chewing. smelling, or seeing food, not just ingesting.**

This is why intermittent fasting is so effective for fat loss. Intermittent fasting is going for 16-24 hours (on average) with only water.

This ensures all the insulin becomes absent in the bloodstream and our body relies heavily on stored fat for energy. It also has many proven health benefits besides fat loss.

Fat loss has never been easier for me.

You can also try doing cardio or any form of exercise on an empty stomach early in the morning when insulin is absent to be sure that all the energy is burned from your fat stores.

## Summary

This is what you should get from this article:
 - Always choose **whole foods** instead of processed foods;
 - Track your foods to achieve a **10% caloric deficit**;
 - **Stay active** throughout the day;
 - **Fall asleep at 10:00 p.m.**;
 - Try **intermittent fasting** and exercise on empty stomach.
