 Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.

Ever since I was 14, I have always wanted to live on my own, to have well paid job, do whatever I want whenver I want however I want. *I have suceeded*.

During college, I was always disgusted to go to class and I couldn't wait to finish it. I also wanted to have my own laptop like all my colleagues. *I have suceeded*.

While living with my father, I always dreamed of affording everything I need - food and clothes - and going to markets without paying attention to my wallet. *I have succeeded*.

Now, I have an amazing apartment, an amazing job, a college degree, I have completely everything a man needs to be happy. Most important, I am healthy and fit. Still, I am not as happy as I should be.

This week, I acted like a spoiled brat. I kept looking on online shops to buy myself either a tablet, either a smartwatch, either a fitness kit, either a smartphone. I kept wanting to buy something new. I can put the blame on my colleagues and say I was influenced, but wouldn't be true.

***The truth is I am not grateful enough.***

{% blockquote %}
If you don't appreciate what you have, you will never have enough and never be satisfied.
{% endblockquote %}

All these possesions we think we need are an ilusion. They are just distractions to keep us busy and unfocused. The reason for my desire to buy something new is I am seeking for something new in my life. I am bored and feeling lonely. It's true! Am want something new in my life, because routine has overwhlmed me.

I have pushed away all the people around me, because they were sickening. All people around me are so disconnected, supperficial, average, sick, pessimists that I felt they held me back, so I eliminated all toxic relationships. As a result, I ended up alone. I would love to have a person around to laught with, to spend time with, to understand me, to help me when I need help, but there is no one.

Buying something new would have only distracted me from this need and emptiness inside me; it would have just mask it. This experience made me again realize how fortunate I am.

When people have nothing to eat, I have more than I need.

When people have nothing to drink, I have more than I need.

When people have an amputated leg, arm, or any other body part, I have both legs, arms, eyes, and all my organs.

When people suffer and die of chronic illness, I am perfeclty healthy.

When people struggle with cold, heat, and bad weather, because they don't have a roof over their heads, I have a wondeful home with all facilities I need.

When people go to hard and miserable working environments, like chemical factories and mines, I have an amazing, well-paid job in an amazing friendly company.

And the list may go on. I have everything I need. So why buy more? Because of boredom? Becuase I can? Becuase others around me have? This is bulls**t! I don't need more possesions. Instead of buying myself a useless phone (I already have one that works fine), I would better donate money to some people who actually need that money.

***All our possessions are just borrowed. When we die, we leave them behind and take with us our spiritual investments***

Better than investing in possessions is investing in experience moments, because they last forever. The more things I have, the more heavier, stressed (responsible), and unfocused I become.

I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.
{% endblockquote %}

As I said, I can afford everything I need and don't need, but I am not happier. Money doesn't make you happy. Money is required to help you on your way to happiness, but they are not happiness itself. Think of money as a traveling method. Your purpose is to reach your destination - happiness and fulfillment - and not the traveling method (i.e. plane, car, ship, etc.).

If you are happy and unfulfilled is not because you don't have money, but because you don't have a purpose. When you have a purpose and you know what you want, money will come, so focus on what your heart is telling you, just as I focused on my true desire - relationships. Also, appreciate everything you have, because there is always someone in need of what you have and you can always lose it.

My biggest treasure is my body, because anyone can buy a new car, a new phone, a new house, but not anyone can aquire health and fitness like I did.

What is your biggest treasure?
