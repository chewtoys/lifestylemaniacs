Why does grandma's recipes taste so damn good?
{% endblockquote %}

If you are one of the children who spent their entire summers together with their grandparents, then you know exactly what I am talking about.<!-- more -->

Do you remember that amazing sent of baking bread or pastries in the oven?

DO you remember that amazing sent of pies, stews, roasts, soups, and all the amazing recipes grandma used to make?

Man they were good. But how did she do it?

Ever since I was a little boy grandma took me with her in the kitchen and "helped" her. I was actually standing in her way, but she was happy I was with her, there. She loved me and I loved her. Let's be honest, whhich grandparents don't love their grandchildren and vice versa? That is where I developed a *taste* for cooking.

I have started cooking - seriously - on my own since I was 15 years old, because I realized the importance of nutritious and good quality food and recipes, all of which I was deprived in my house. So, I realized I had to do something about it and start preparing my food on my own.

Of course I have always tried to recreate the recipes I grew with, but I never seemed to succeed; there was always something missing. But what? I mean, I put the exact ingredients and followed the exact instructions my grandmother used, but still my recipes were far from being as delicious as my grandma's.

It was only until a few years ago and now mostly that she did something I didn't.

Grandma cooked with passion, love, and dedication.
{% endblockquote %}

The difference was I was cooking, but I was not fully in the moment like my grandmother was. And I believe this happens to all of us nowadays. We cook just to have something to eat, in a rush, and we are always thinking what is the next task, whereas our grandparents - ancestors actually - when they were cookin', they were cookin'. No distractions, nothing else mattered. They invested all their thoughts, feelings, and energy in the food they prepared. Thus, their positive energy converted into something delicious and healthy.

During college I was the same. Because I felt I had few time I was always cooking in a rush, with a disgust even. It was no longer a pleasure for me, hence, my recipes used to rotten fast, look ugly, and taste not so delightful.

After I finished college this summer and went to my grandmother again, I did not have a food processor or blender and I made all my recipes by hand. I have to be honest, the food tasted amazing. It was like somebody else made it. Reason? I was in the moment. I had no worries, no rushing thoughts, or negative emotions. I knew that was my time to cook.

My father was a little bit dissapointed yesterday that all the food he makes gets rotten the day after. I lived with him during the alst years and I saw the way he cooks. He makes huge quantities of soups or stews in order to avoid cooking oftenly and he always throws away half of it, either because it gets rotten, either because they no longer want it. What a waste right? Even I developed this habit and wasted huge amounts of food.

When others are starving, others are throwing away food. This means disrespect for food, for the farmers who grew the food, and for ourselves, because we worked our ass of to provide the money to buy the food and cook it.

Our grandparents are the last of our ancestors who knew how to live and we have to learn from them again, while they are still alive. Let's not let their secrets die with them. I still have 3 grandparents - my grandfather died last year - and I should honor them while I still can, because 50% of my skills and personality have developed by living with them.
