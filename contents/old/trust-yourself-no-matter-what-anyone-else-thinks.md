The Man who says he can, and the man who says he can not.. Are both correct
{% endblockquote %}

There are so many things I would have done in the past and which I would still do, but I was afraid to do it. I was afraid aboout what others might think of me. I was paralyzed by the fear of failure. I did not trust myself enough and still don't and this is the biggest sin one could ever commit. You know why?<!-- more -->

When you don't trust yourself, you actually don't trust God, because God is within you. You can't have faith in God without having faith in yourself and you can't have faith in yourself wihout having faith in God.
Ever since we are children we are told what to do, where to go, where are told not to mistake because it's wrong; we are limited by the fear of our parents and by grown ups. Fear drives stress, anger, hate, dissapointed, sadness, and evil. Fear omes from our ineer desire to know everything, to control everything, and from our desire for security. I have learned that nothing in life is promised except death, so why spend our lives in fear?

Mistakes and failures are the only way one could learn. They are the actual processes of developing skill. A gazzelle has to fall first before able to walk and run, a child has to fall first befaore able to ride a bike or roller skates, each worrior had to take painful hits before beaing able to defend himself. There is no learning without failure.

As long as you keep going, you never lose. You either win or learn.

All successfull peaople new from the beginning that there is no such thing as success without failure - adversity. This is the difference between average and masters. Average is being so afraid of failure, of having so low confidence, that never even try.
I consider myself a little higher than average, but I haven't reached my full potential. I have always wanter to be a singer, dancer, nutritionist, but my father always said you can't. I can't say I am not fine now, I have everything I want and I ams till singing, dancing, and being a nutritionist as a hobby, but I still have that question within: "What if...?".

What if I followed my heart and focused on music?

What if I followed my heart and focused on health and fitness?

My life is not over, it's actually only at the beggining. I finished college, I have a great job as a web developer, I have an amazing team with whom I work with, but it's not what represents me. I mean, there definetely is another person who can do what I do. It's not something unique to me. I know I am destined for something bigger, for something that only I can do, the same way as all of you out there. We are all special. We all have a gift that no one else has.

So many of us see ourselves as something amazing in the future. When we are children we dream so much, because we can see infinite potential in this Universe, but our mind is locked inside a box and we are forbbided to dream. We must follow the lead and the rules and become a part of the system and sustain the businesses - we become batteries.

We are all [creators of our own lives](/2017/08/12/be-the-star-of-your-own-movie) - the producers and stars - and our job is to make it and award winning movie in this Universe. And the only way to do it is by listening to our own inner voice the lies in the heart - God - and have the courage to follow it.

I read about all the geniuses who have been laughed at because of their brilliant ideas, though outrages back than. some of them were even killed because of saying the world moves around the sun and not the other way around. But they believed in their vision. They knew they were enlightened and that what they saw and felt was real. As a result, their names and legacies live forever.

We as population have been turned over each other. We should be respecting, helping, encouraging each other, but no; we are judging, hating, discriminating each other. All other species live in harmony, but we live in chaos and war. If we see a person who is talented, hard-working, ambitious, and, as a result, better than us at something we are so frustrated with ourselves, we are so jealeous that we immediately do our best to bring him/her down so that we don't appear inferior. Why try to appreciate the person and try to improve ourselves? It's easier to criticies. All nay sayers and rude critics are jealeuous, but we should never be moved by them. We should be empowered by them and never give them energy.

We spend more time looking at what other people around are doing insead of looking at ourselves, at our life. We are disconnected from our lives; we are no longer acting and producing our own movie, but rather helping others produce theirs. We play second roles in other poeple's lives who had the courage to pursue their dream; who had faith.

I am sick of this. I am sick of being a battery and seing other people being batteries. I want to have more faith and we all can; it's just a matter of training and persistance. The hardest thing to do is making the first step.

It alls starts with confidence; when you have high confidence, high self-esteem - when you love youself - you begin to trust yourself. Believe me, I know. When I was fat, I had the lowest confidence one could have, but as soon as I started exercising more and loosing body fat, I gained more confidence. Invest more time in yourself. Love yourself don't hate yourself. Improve your health and fitness and as you see yourself becoming healthier, fitter, you will feel amazing. You feel stronger and disciplined and people around will see. When you look good, feel good, and spread your positive energy around, people will feel your energy and respect you. People treat you the way you treat yourself so treat yourself well, because you deserve it; we all do. We deserve the best.

Develop a positive mindset. Smile more even when you don't feel like it. Give more rather than request more. Do what you cand with what you have where you are. The smallest things count the most. You will see in time how you change.

Find out what you love and do it. Spend more time with yourself alone so that you can hear that inner voice. When you are always surounded by people your inner voice is silenced. Also, don't tell people what you love or you want to do. They won't understand, because they can't feel and see what you feel and see. The crazier the better. When you tell people what you plan to do they will disscourage you, including your family. Your family loves you and wants you to be secure and struggle free. They don't understand that the way to happiness is filled with struggles and obstacles. Life is filled with obstacles and that is what makes us feel alive. When we go safe at low standards we don't feel the excitement of risks and unexpectation. We don't raise our heart rate. The biggest enemies are not our family and friends though, but ourselves. We keep discouraging ourselves with our thoughts. Our mind and body is conservative and wants to preserve energy. Thus, it always seeks comfort, but comfort is bad. Comfort is opposite to evolution. Comfort is stagnation. The only way to evolve is by getting out the comfort zone.

{% blockquote African Proverb %}
If there is no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm.
{% endblockquote %}

I realized that the only way to change the world is by changing myself. The world is not changed through lecture, but by example - through inspiration. As I said, don't tell others what you are doing; show them. Slap them in the face with your accomplishments and I guraantee you the satisfaction is enourmous.
Discipline yourself and develop the confidence to trust yourself and, thus, have faith in God.

{% blockquote Matthew 17:20 %}
Because you have so little faith. He answered. “For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.
{% endblockquote %}

When we have faith in ourselves and God unconditionally we are invincible. When we substitute fear with love, the Universe is in our hands. Fear is the root of all unhappiness, sickness, and evil, whereas love is happiness, health, peace, prosperity, and good. When we hate we are afraid. When are have anxiety and we are stressed, we are afraid. When we hate, we are afraid. When we have anger, we are afraid. Fear and love are the only two feelings and courage comes from love, not from fear. Cowardness comes from fear. Love brings courage, ambition, strength, and evolution. Also, love for oneself brings confidence in one self.

***You are destined for miraculous things. Don't be afraid of greatness, be afraid of average. When you are average, you are commiting spiritual suicide.***
