{% blockquote Nelson Mandela %}
I never lose. I either win or learn. 
{%  endblockquote %}

Whenever you look at a plant and you notice it's not thriving or not giving fruits, you can immediately suppose it's dying. This is the law of life: if you're note thriving you're dying. When it comes to humans, the only way to thrive is through learning.

The reason I can't stand spending time around around the majority of old people, including the telephone, is not necessarily because they are old, but because of their mentality. They always say: "I am too old for that!".

you see, our body is getting old, it's how life, nature, and the universe works. Whatever has beginning, has an end. That's no excuse for you to think like an old man. Your soul has no beginning and no end.

The moment you let your inner child go away, the moment you stop being curious, the moment you stop asking questions, the moment you stop enjoying life, the moment you stop being excited about a new day of your life, is the moment you have died.

when we are children, life seems limitless. We believe and feel we have infinite potential. We don't care about anything, we just do whatever our instinct - gut - is telling us. We live and enjoy life every second, every hour, every hour! It's the adults who prevent us from flying and dreaming! With their serious mindset and their frustration of themselves, they destroy our life. **The biggest mistake we are taught is that it's wrong to make mistakes**. We should be punished whenever we make mistakes.

Mistakes and failures are the processes of learning. Pain is the process of growth... and we are taught not to do that.
{% endblockquote %}

**It's like saying: "hey, go fix the car engine, but don't get dirt on your hands".**

I recently watched the movie *Up* and it inspired me to write this article. Seeing that child filled of life and excitement of living at full potential getting old, miserable, frustrated, and looking with contemplation and disappointment (of himself) at his "My adventure book" containing "Stuff I am going to do" which were never accomplished reminded me of my grandparents and the majority of people who end up old and unfulfilled.

This happens most of the times with people who get married. My opinion - advice - is you should never get married until you realize who you are and your purpose on this planet. When you get married your mind and soul is occupied with other things and you have no longer time to contemplate on yourself, on what makes you happy, on your purpose on this planet, on self-development, on self-discovery. As a result, you'll end up disappointed, frustrated, and you'll put the blame on your family. And if your children grow up and your partner dies, you end up - like in the movie Up - alone and with a bag filled with unaccomplished dreams.

{% blockquote Les Brown %}
Imagine if you will being on your death bed – And standing around your bed – the ghosts of the ideas, the dreams, the abilities, the talents given to you by life.
And that you for whatever reason, you never acted on those ideas, you never pursued that dream, you never used those talents, we never saw your leadership, you never used your voice, you never wrote that book.
And there they are standing around your bed looking at you with large angry eyes saying we came to you, and only you could have given us life! Now we must die with you forever.
The question is – if you die today what ideas, what dreams, what abilities, what talents, what gifts, would die with you?
{% endblockquote %}

We live in the information age. Information has never been more available and abundant as today. And with a rocket in our pockets, the only way we cannot learn is if we don't want to.

My grandpa used to tell me, ***"Read! Read, boy! Whatever comes into your hands, read it!"***

**Warren Buffet when asked once about the key to success, pointed to a stack of books and said, "Read 500 pages like this every day. That's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it... I read and think, so I do more reading and thinking and make fewer impulse decisions than most people in the business. I do it because I like this kind of life."**

I now read every day, mostly facts about health, philosophy, software, and sometimes fiction. I am also reading by listening to podcasts and audiobooks while I am around the house and walking outside. I cannot imagine a day of my life without learning something new. A day without learning something new is a lost day.

You can go to my [resources page](https://razvantomegea.com/resources/) and look for some books I shared on Amazon. If you don't like any, learn whatever you want, just [don't make excuses](https://razvantomegea.com/2017/12/22/whats-your-excuse/). 

Never stop growing.
