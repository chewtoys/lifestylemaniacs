Whenever I speak with my grandmother and I tell her about my new findings in health she always replies: "You see you're studying and researching and you know how to stay healthy, but..." and theeeere it goes. That "but". But what? What is stopping you from studying and researching human health (anatomy, physiology, etc)? Do you have your neurons tied up? Does somebody tie your arms to cover your eyes and prevents you from studying? That's what always comes to my mind: what the f**k keeps you from doing what I do? The answer is you.

This is just an isolated example. My grandmother always comes up with some sort of excuse and victimisation for her fulfillment. She always runs from the responsibility of her misfortune. She never says: I f**ked up.

For goodness sake, take responsibility for your decisions and life. Yes, maybe your life is not how you have imagined or wanted it to be:
- you are not healthy;
- you have a crappy job;
- you are fat;
- you have low grades.

You name it. Whatever your disappointment is, stop beating yourself up. Your life is as it is. You can't change who you know; this is the result of your past decisions. You can change what are you going to become. You have to make a choice, you can continue pitting, waining, and come up with excuses for your misfortune, or you decide to do something about it here and know.

A common excuse among parents is: "well, yeah, he doesn't have a family to look after, so...". So what? That excuse, from the psychological point of view, suggests you are hating your family. you put the blame on them because you f**ked up. Take some responsibility for your decisions and life. You the reason you are where you are period accept it and move on.

Snap out of this stupid mindset! Just stop for a second and visualize your life. Forget about the past and the future. There is only the present. Stop letting your mind control you and your life.

Say to yourself: "I am sick and tired of being sick and tired!". Look where you are and what you have and embrace it. Use who you ware to your own advantage.

If you are not healthy, fight for it and learn what you need to do to be healthy.
If you don't have money fight for it. Use your head and discover your skills. Don't have skills? Create them!
If you are unhappy with your family, fight for it!
If you are unhappy with your job, change it or make a business!

Whatever it is, you need to fight! You need to get out of your comfort zone! Change, development, growth only happens when you get out of your comfort zone! It takes discipline and persistence! Start small and keep going slowly day by day.

Whatever you do just do it know and stop making excuses and putting the blame on others. Your life is your job. If you can't change it, accept it and move forward.
